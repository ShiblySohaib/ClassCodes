Problem:1------> Bonous Problem?????

Majnu has N friends. Majnu promised that he would gift a pair of shoes (consisting of one left shoe and one right shoe)
to each of his N friends.Majnu was about to go to the Newmarket to buy shoes, 
but he suddenly remembers that he already had M left shoes.What is the minimum number of extra shoes that Chef will 
have to buy to ensure that he is able to gift a pair of shoes to each of his N friends?

For example, if N=2, M=4, then Majnu already has 4 left shoes, 
so he must buy 2 extra right shoes to form 2 pairs of shoes.
Therefore Majnu must buy at least 2 extra shoes to ensure that he is able to get N=2 pairs of shoes.

Each test case contains two integers N and M - the number of 
Majnu's friends and the number of left shoes Chef has.

Output the minimum number of extra shoes that Chef will have to buy to 
ensure that he is able to get N pairs of shoes.

Problem 3: Using function--->

A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a 'symmetrical' number like 19891, 
that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In this problem you will be given an integer, 
you have to say whether the number is a palindromic number or not.

Each case starts with a line containing an integer n.

For each case print Yes if n is palindromic, otherwise print No.

Sample Input

1
21
16161
523125

Sample Output
Yes
No
Yes
No


Problem 4:

Your friend Dablu. Recenty he has started his programming journey. 
Dablu tells you that he likes array. Now you asked Dablu to check whether a given value 
or element exists in an array or not.

Each case starts with a line containing an integer n the size of array
and n size consist n elements and also a integer B.

For each case print Yes if the B element is found, otherwise print No.
